# this is a bibleApp...
But not just any bible app. There's a dozen Bible apps out there and they're wonderful, 
however, there is a reasonable number of people who don't have access to them for a number of reasons. 
Mine is that I don't possess a smartphone (shoutout to light phone) and i have friends and family who are in the same boat.
the fix? a light phone bible app. You will be able to send an SMS from your light phone (or other non smart phone)
and get back a reference (eg. Genesis 1:1) a range (Ezekiel 11:19-21) or a whole chapter! (John 1).
Take the Holy Words of God with you wherever you go! with the Light Phone Bible App. [Not exclusive to Light Phone users]
